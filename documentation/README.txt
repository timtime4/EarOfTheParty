	Ear of the Party is a democratic playlist sharing app that
allows a host to "share" a playlist of local must to any number of 
attendees. Attendees then have the ability to upvote or downvote
songs on the playlist to influence the order of playback based on
preference. The app is authenticated through Firebase, and only metadata of
songs in a playlist is stored on the database. Note that a playlist
created by a host can only be played on the device on which it was created.
In order to join a party as an attendee, the user must search for the name of
the party exactly as it was created.
